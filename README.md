# NebulaNet
NebulaNet is a cutting-edge data science hackathon organized by the physics department of IIT BHU for Jigyasa. Participants were provided with a Dataset containing astrophysical data. They had to train a Machine Learning Model which optimizes the given dataset, focusing on how ml techniques can be applied to physics research.
